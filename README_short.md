# Binary Tree Traversal
Set of programming assignments that are designed to test knowledge of traversal methods for binary trees.


## Problem 1: Check whether two trees are the same

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.


## Problem 2: Get inorder traversal of binary tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.


## Problem 3: Get postorder traversal of binary tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.


## Problem 4: Get preorder traversal of binary tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.


## Problem 5: Get level order traversal of binary tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
